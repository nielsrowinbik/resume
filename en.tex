\section{Work experience}
\label{sec:work}

\cvsubsection{Stuvia}[Product Manager][Remote][2023-present]
\begin{itemize}
    \item Formalised product management as first product hire, laying the groundwork for user-centric, data-informed development.
    \item Influenced company leadership to create a formal company strategy, authored a corresponding product strategy, and introduced and maintained an internal product roadmap to guide cross-team alignment and drive coordinated execution.
    \item Introduced a lightweight process for user interviews and prototype testing to validate ideas before development.
    \item Together with the product designer I hired,f ormalised and standardised the product’s UI/UX, incrementally introducing a new design system across new features and changes to modernise the user experience without a costly full rebuild.
    \item Built a Next.js web app with a reusable and accessible React component library based on the design system, letting marketing update static pages independently from engineering and ensuring consistent, high-quality UI.
\end{itemize}

\cvsubsection{ProRail}[Product Manager][Utrecht, NL][2018-2022]
\begin{itemize}
    \item Led four product teams and revamped the engineering process for \enquote{Donna} (software used for capacity allocation of the Dutch railroad system, with its primary output being the timetable), re-introducing foundational Scrum practices and a focus on delivering working software, resulting in 100\% fewer service interruptions directly following each quarterly release.
    \item Defined product vision and strategy for the first time since launch in 2005; secured stakeholder buy-in for a full overhaul and introduced structured discovery practices to shift from output to outcome across all levels.
    \item Established a hiring procedure and led a team of six product managers after scaling up development efforts for Donna.
    \item Launched an improved (80+\% fewer false positives, unknown amount of fewer false negatives, 50\% faster) conflict-detection module for Donna with accompanying visualisation, vastly improving the quality of the timetable and laying the foundation for important technological advancements for the Dutch rail sector such as Automatic Train Operation (ATO).
\end{itemize}

\cvsubsection{ProRail}[Associate Product Manager (i.a.) (parttime)][Utrecht, NL][2016-2018]
