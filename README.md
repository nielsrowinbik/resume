# Resume

My resume, written in LaTeX.

## PDF Output

The PDF output for both source files, `en.tex` and `nl.tex`, containing both an English and Dutch version of my resume, can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/nielsrowinbik/resume/releases). I use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions) to automatically compile and release new versions of my resume when I push commits to this repository. I edit the source files in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).
